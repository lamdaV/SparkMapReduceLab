The world of Eos is comprised of three continents: Lucis, Accordo, and Niflheim. The
northeastern land of Lucis possesses a powerful Crystal, which was gifted by the gods in
antiquity to the reigning Caelum dynasty. Accordo, located in the south, is made up of islands and has been annexed by the Niflheim empire, which lies to the west and benefits from
its advanced magitek technology. The province of Tenebrae is under Niflheim's control, but
maintains some autonomy due to the presence of the Oracle, a priestess who has the power to
fight the Starscourge, a plague that lengthens nights and turns people and animals into
vicious daemons. Watching over Eos are the Astrals, divine beings that can appear in the
mortal realm, usually as colossal and powerful beings.
For hundreds of years Lucis and Niflheim have been at war. While many lands have been lost
to the empire, the Lucian capital of Insomnia remains untouched due to the Wall, a barrier
maintained by the king and the Crystal's magic. Peace talks have begun in hopes of bringing
an end to the conflict, one of the conditions being a marriage of Prince Noctis and Lady
Lunafreya.
